      </header>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>Working together on this bilingual ELT website expanded our knowledge of inclusive education,
        digital pedagogy, and curriculum design. We discovered how technology may improve English
        instruction by making it more learner-centred, interactive, and accessible. Each member was
        able to offer their special talents while learning new techniques in research, design, and
        reflective practice thanks to the division of duties. We produced a unified, CAPS-aligned
        product because to cooperation and open communication, even though time management and
        concept alignment were difficult. Professionally, we enhanced our lesson design and ICT
        integration abilities; personally, we developed self-assurance, inventiveness, and an
        appreciation for teamwork in accomplishing common learning objectives.</p>

          <p>I was able to combine academic accuracy with flair when creating and modifying the website. I gained knowledge on how to convert textual lesson materials into an interactive, approachable
            style that benefits both educators and students. I learnt how collaboration and regular
            communication produce professional outcomes from overseeing the group reflections. I also
            improved my digital literacy, design, and referencing abilities. This event demonstrated how
            cooperation promotes accountability and how user-friendly design improves learning. In my
            personal life, I became more comfortable using digital media to convey academic work, and in
            my working life, I became more accountable for the coherence and quality of group projects.</p>

        <div class="member-ref-body">
          <p>I was able to make the connection between theory and real-world application by contributing 
            to both the Grade 6 lesson plan and the Administration portion. I developed a better grasp of curriculum integration throughout phases while helping to define goals, objectives, and CAPS alignment. I was able to put those ideas into practice by creating the Grade 6 communicative lesson, which included innovative, technology-based exercises appropriate for younger students. I learnt how planning facilitates meaningful learning experiences by striking a balance between structure and involvement. Working on the administrative material enhanced my comprehension of inclusive, outcomes-based education and the significance of technology in language development, while working with teammates honed my research and design abilities.</p>

        <div class="member-ref-body">
          <p>Working on the administrative and lesson-planning aspects forced me to consider language instruction from a broad perspective. While creating the Grade 9 poetry lesson enhanced my creative and critical-thinking abilities, writing the Administration tab required extensive involvement with CAPS and the ATP to verify curriculum accuracy. I discovered that, particularly when students engage with digital tools and visual aids, technology can help close the gap between theory and classroom practice. My professionalism and time management both increased as a result of juggling both tasks. My enthusiasm for developing inclusive, multimodal English programs that foster student participation and academic confidence was strengthened by this encounter.</p>
